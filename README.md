## Hi, I'm Dan :wave:

I've been working in tech since 2007 as a full-stack web application developer, engineering manager, and enterprise architect.
I am passionate about:

Engineering involves focused, technical work.
The _context_ of engineering work determines its _nature_.
Professionals work in organizations; the power structures in organizations influence the _behavior_ of people and teams.
The net result of behavior aggregated at different levels of the organization determines the operational context where engineering work takes place.

To be an effective leader in an engineering organization, you must understand the technical domain and how to _interpret_ and _influence_ the business context.
Guiding teams is a rewarding set of challenges, but it can get complicated.
Spending time on self-directed side projects is a refreshing pallet cleanser after wrestling with [ill-defined problems][2].
