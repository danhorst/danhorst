## Hi, I'm Dan :wave:

I've been working in tech since 2007 as a full-stack web developer, engineering manager, and enterprise architect. I love building _resilient systems_, designing _great developer experiences_, and tackling _complex product challenges_.

### I'm passionate about

:notebook: Clear, thoughtful technical communication  
:computer: Crafting software that balances elegance and practicality  
:dart: Coaching teams to thrive at the intersection of technology and business  
:books: Continuous learningâ€”from systems architecture to rocketry

### I believe

Engineering is _focused technical work_ but it never happens in a vacuum.

The _business context_ shapes the _nature_ of the work.  
The _power structures_ in organizations shape _behavior_.  
The _aggregate behavior_ across levels of an organization creates the _functional[^1] engineering environment_.

To be a leader in tech, you need:

- Deep _technical expertise_
- To correctly _interpret_ and _influence_ the business context

Guiding teams through this landscape is a rewarding challenge. When I'm not wrestling with [ill-defined problems][1], I find it refreshing to build things for my own edification. [Check out my rocketry projects.][2]

[^1]: Or _dysfunctional_
