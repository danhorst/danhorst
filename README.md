## Hi, I'm Dan :wave:

I've been working in tech since 2007 as a full-stack web application developer, team lead, and enterprise architect.

I am passionate about:  
:notebook: Clear technical communication  
:computer: Developer happiness  
:sparkles: Product design  
:anchor: Resilient systems  
:rocket: [Rockets][1]

Engineering isn't bounded by the stack.
Shipping the right things made the right way takes people, culture, strategy, focus, and experimentation.
