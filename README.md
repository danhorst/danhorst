## Hi, I'm Dan :wave:

I am passionate about:  
:notebook: Clear technical communication  
:computer: Developer happiness  
:sparkles: Product design  
:rocket: [Rockets][1]

I've been working in tech since 2007 as a full-stack web application developer, team lead, and enterprise architect.

I am fascinated with behavior, performance, and the boundaries between systems both in product—human & interface, frontend & backend, backend & infrastructure—and management—person & team, team & organization, task & objective, objective & goal.
